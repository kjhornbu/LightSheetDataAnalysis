This is an updated (python workbook with analysis cleaned to most final of figures -- group and indiv point-- and paths to key files and saving locations generalized) form of Yuqi Tian's python analysis done for light sheet microscopy data presented in the Nature Neuroscience paper titled "Impact of Alzheimer's disease on brain and behavior in mice: Magnetic resonance microscopy resolves widespread effects." 

Analysis process is detailed in python notebook titled: "Yuqi_Data_Analysis_Code.ipynb". Output will save in folder titled "Running_Python_Outputs" within current working directory. Must have the Data (ie the files in "Original_Yuqi_DataSheets") located in a folder of that same name in the current working directory for this script to run.
